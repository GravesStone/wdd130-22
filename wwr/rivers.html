                </h1>
                <p> It is the only city in the country that offers rafting year-round.

                You can opt to conquer just 14 rapids or go for all 21 of them!The rapids are at an internval of not less than 10-15 minutes of each other.Truly whitewater rafting on the Cagayan River has everything that makes for a one-of-a-kind thrill with awesome roar and power of water cascading over rocks and boulders.

                    Colorado River, Grand Canyon, USA
                </h1>
                <p> Grand Canyon is considered one of the finest examples of arid-land erosion in the world. Incised by the Colorado River, the canyon is immense, averaging 4,000 feet deep for its entire 277 miles. It is 6,000 feet deep at its deepest point and 18 miles at its widest. However, the significance of Grand Canyon is not limited to its geology.
                    The Park contains several major ecosystems. Its great biological diversity can be attributed to the presence of five of the seven life zones and three of the four desert types in North America.
