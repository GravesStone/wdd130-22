        Baguio City, it’s shows foods in the site, In Baguio there have a 6.3ºC, they mostly visit there because of the culture, nature and temperature. The city enjoys a cool temperate climate typically 19.3 degrees centigrade. Temperature dips to as low as 10 degrees in the cold months of December, January and February. This is due to its elevation of 1,500 meters above mean sea level and its pine clad topography. Dry season is from November to April and wet season for the rest of the months. Through the numerous decades Baguio has morphed from what was once a grassy marshland into one of the cleanest and greenest, most highly urbanized cities in the country. It has made its mark as a premiere tourist destination in the Northern part of the Philippines with its cool climate, foggy hills, panoramic views and lovely flowers. 
There has a different activity in Grizzly Deluxe Hiking and Zip Line, In Hiking they have a chance to see the sea of cloud in peak of the mountain, In Zip Line they can able to experience the pine trees near at the mountains.
